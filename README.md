# Tip Calculator
Tip Calculator is a simple Python application designed to help users quickly calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a restaurant bill, including a tip. The program prompts the user for the total bill amount, the tip percentage they wish to leave (commonly 15%, 18%, or 20%), and the number of people sharing the bill. It then computes the tip, adds it to the bill total, and evenly divides the final amount among all participants.

## Features
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface:** The application guides you through inputting the necessary details.
- **Customizable Tip Percentage:** Users can choose the tip percentage that suits their service quality or personal preference.
- **Bill Splitting:** Automatically calculates the amount each person should pay by dividing the total (bill + tip) evenly.
- **Rounded Output:** Ensures the final per-person amount is rounded to two decimal places, making it ideal for monetary calculations.
